impact-rankings    -> Community leaderboard and competitions
```

### Impact Flow
1. **Action Selection**: Users choose from available eco-actions
2. **Submission**: Submit evidence for verification if required
3. **Verification**: Admin verifies high-impact submissions
4. **Reward**: Automatic point and token rewards
5. **Progression**: Green level advancement and leaderboard updates

## üöÄ Getting Started

   ```clarity
   (submit-eco-action action-id evidence-hash)
   ```

2. **Track Progress**: Monitor your environmental impact
   ```clarity
   (get-user-impact user-address)
   ```

3. **Claim Rewards**: Exchange points for green tokens
   ```clarity
